Extending Method to 3 Layers: (Just Theorizing...)

- Will have 4 Equations describing how source travels across layers (Exterior -> Middle): 2 Equations, 4 Unknowns -> 2 Unknowns
(Middle->Interior): 2 Equations, 4 Unknowns -> 2 Unknowns

Will likely need to solve each system individually (Will do solving method twice...?)

- Will have three layers to make grid from.

- Will need to track how source changes as it goes from layer to layer...
	Exterior to Middle -> What happens? Then, using results at boundary where Middle meets Interior....
	Middle to Interior -> What happens? 

- Perhaps Exterior to Middle will be the same as Transmission, except will need to track condition when Middle grid meets the Interior boundary...

Then, when Middle grid meets Interior boundary, will repeat Transmission method but with Middle to Interior instead.

Will need to do same preliminary when all k values are the same to validate.

How will we track when Middle grid meets Interior boundary?  (Use xbdy and ybdy of boundary when calculated from function?  Use normal vector... stop when it crosses?)
