This repository contains all Jupyter Notebooks used for the duration of this research project.  The main notebook of interest is titled 'Transmission.ipynb', which contains the combined methods used in the 'Exterior Acoustic Scattering via Representation' and the 'Interior Acoustic Scattering via Representation' notebooks.

Notebook in current development is 'Cloaking.ipynb', where we attempt to extend the methods implemented in 'Transmission.ipynb' to 3 layers in order to simulate optical cloaking.
